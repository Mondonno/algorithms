## Algorithms
Popular algorithms, everyone (mostly everyone) known and some created on my own

## How?

- **Every algorithm** in sreperated file need to work sreperatly, without using sources from another.
- **Every algorithm** is easy to cut and copy into your own code.
- **Every algorithm** is supposed to be fast, not necessarily readable
